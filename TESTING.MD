## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
   - Redirection Error: The original issue was related to a redirection error when trying to redirect to window.location.origin at the end of the game. We fixed this by changing it to a relative URL using window.location.href = "https://anastassiiabondarenko.github.io/fish_game/";. This ensures that the game redirects to the link of the page, which should work correctly.


   - Bug: Score and Timer Icons Disappearing
Description: Score and timer icons were disappearing when the game started because they were placed inside <span> elements, and the JavaScript code was modifying the content of these elements.
Solution: The icons were repositioned outside of the <span> elements in the HTML structure, and the JavaScript code was adjusted to target the <span> element directly for updating the timer's text content. This separation of icons and text content resolved the issue.
